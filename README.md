## Small Media Player \(must see\!\)


</div>

### Description

This is a very small and compact media player. It doesn't use Windows Media Player, but rather the API to play the files. I have noticed that when you play WAV and MIDI files that the time doesn't work. I'm currently seeing what I can do about that, but other than that everything works great. I hope to get some feedback and please vote. I hope you enjoy this, but atleast you could learn how to play media files w/o windows media player.
